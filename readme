Project animation of a checker game


Contains 3 src folder: backend, uiComponents, main

Backend: the back-end is the foundation of the app and controls how the UI components is modified.
It crucial operations to the game/animation. Make sure each piece take turns. Check if a move is valid, if the game is over, etc.


uiComponent: is contains the ui components essential for the game. Namely the BOARD and the pieces and methods that update the board 
visually.

main: this is where our application is ran. Our main frame is here and this is where I use both component of the backend and uiComponent 
to make the animation run smoothly
